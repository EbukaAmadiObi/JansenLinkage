# JansenLinkage
This repository contains Python code for analyzing and animating the dynamic behavior of a [Jansen mechanical linkage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jansen%27s_linkage) using closure equations and Gaussian elimination methods. The project includes numerical solutions, iterative methods, and a 3D animation of the linkageâ€™s trajectory.
